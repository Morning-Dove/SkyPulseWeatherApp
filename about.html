            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>I am an eager entry-level web developer with a strong desire to continue learning and pursuing my passion for creating innovative and user-friendly web applications. 
                I am constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities to expand my skill set and stay up-to-date with the latest industry trends. 
                My enthusiasm for web development drives me to explore new technologies and refine my abilities, ensuring that I am well-prepared to contribute effectively to any team or project.
                <br>
                <br>
                Practicing a project like SkyPulse is incredibly beneficial for me as an entry-level web developer because it covers a broad range of essential web development skills. 
                By building a basic weather application, I gain hands-on experience with real-world APIs, like the weather.gov API, which is crucial for integrating external data sources into web applications. 
                This project also helped me understand HTML, CSS, and JavaScript better, as I needed to create a responsive and interactive user interface using components like modals, navbars, and sidebars from Bootstrap. 
                Incorporating a line chart from Chart.js introduces me to data visualization techniques, which are important for creating engaging and informative user experiences. 
                Additionally, developing multiple pages such as "About," "FAQ," and "Contact Me," along with forms and validation, strengthens my ability to build comprehensive and user-friendly websites. 
                This hands-on experience is invaluable in preparing me for the challenges of real-world projects and demonstrating my competency to potential employers.
